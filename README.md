# TeachandLearn

Teach and Learn is an Android app that allows students to find volunteer tutors (and vice versa) in their area. This helps
high school students get volunteer hours, and helps students from lower grade levels get free help nearby. I made this app
for CU Hacks 3, and won second place with it in the advanced category. Some new features are still being implemented, so the
app's functionality may be impaired.
